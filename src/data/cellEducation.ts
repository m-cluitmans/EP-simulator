      <p>An action potential is a rapid change in membrane potential that occurs in excitable cells like cardiac myocytes. The cardiac action potential has several distinct phases:</p>
      <ol>

        <li><strong>Phase 1:</strong> Early repolarization</li>
        <li><strong>Phase 2:</strong> Plateau</li>
        <li><strong>Phase 3:</strong> Repolarization</li>
